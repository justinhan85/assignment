# About me
I am a 5th year PhD student working at Coral Reef Ecology Lab and Hunter Lab. My research focuses on nutrient impacts on coral and coral bleaching. I am taking this course because my research has been mainly focused on colony level physiological changes from stressors, so I believe this is a good opportunity to experience different approaches to studying corals and coral reefs. I want to get out of this class to expand my knowledge about the structural perspective of coral reefs and their role in physiological/ecological changes in corals. I am definitely not super familiar with R program, but I understand the basics of R programs and how coding works. Fun Fact about me is that I am allergic to coral.
